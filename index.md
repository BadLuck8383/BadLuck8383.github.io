### CPSC 120

* Lab 6 - 
Lab six was a crucial lab for me as it laid down the very foundation that I would continue to use in every program since its introduction and several personal programs that would take the user input and output a simple yet vitally important part of development. The first part gently and swiftly introduced us, creating light-hearted times using the development of a sandwich as a metaphor. Moving to part 2’s card game development was a daunting task at hand with large functions required to tell the game how to operate. However, due to the presence of the first part, things became understandable and fit into place smoothly once we were able to compare the two objectives. 

* Lab 8 - 
Lab eight wasn't a vastly challenging or important lab in comparison to many previous to it. However, its judge scores concept iterated the importance of a mathematical understanding in ways other programs didn't reinventing my determination to push through calculus for a Computer science major. This was also the first program to display the importance of a fair code, showing the influence programs could have on their users. A single error could take a victory from those who deserve it or cost others large parts of their life if left unchecked and uncared for.

* Lab 12 -
Lab twelve was the single most controversial within the class, in the lecture prior we were shown a physical representation of the code through colorful visuals exciting the class for the coming lab but upon arrival, the Magic input through Ubuntu hadn't been properly installed or an error within Ubuntu had occurred causing the program to have a permanent error at the top of the code that prevented others from appearing as we typed AND prevented the code from running. So while we created what was a hypothetically working program there was no way of checking its functionality aside from the T.A.’s word of approval. On the following hours after the lab the error had been addressed and solved allowing everyone’s laptops to function as anticipated and the visuals to be properly represented and when they were it was an amazing feeling to create my first display within a program.
